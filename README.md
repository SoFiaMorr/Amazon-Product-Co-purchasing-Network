We collected data from our datasets and made custom dataset.
Then we used standard methods of graph analysis and visualisation.
After we build two models: Book recommendation and Link prediction.
As we see, their results and metrics are good, so we can say they are working and ready to use. 
That means GNN methods are better than orthodox functions of graph analysis.
